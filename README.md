# SMART-CROP-SUGGESTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-SOIL-CLIMATE-DATA
This project builds a smart crop suggestion system using ML models like RF, KNN, SVM &amp; Na√Øve Bayes to predict suitable crops based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, aiding farmers in making data-driven decisions.
